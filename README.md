# DataAnalyticsProject1 - The Premier League's Big 6

### Disclaimer: All data sets used were publicly available on Kaggle, a trusted source, but regardless the data may not be 100 % perfect. There was missing data, which had to be filled in during my analysis.

The goal of this project was to use data in storytelling of the Top 6 for my first data analysis project, through the data analysis tools of Python and Power BI. I found a premier league data set on kaggle and combined with the python library pandas was able to gain meangful insights from the data set. Have a look at the code if interested there are comments explaining it. Also I used Power BI through tp create a dashboard of data findings related to Manchester United.

Tools used: Python (Pandas), Power BI

### A Look at the Big 6's Premier League Journeys


Manchester United - A team that has gone from sheer dominance to a decline. They are the most decorated club in Premier League history, with 13 titles, a feat achieved thanks to the effort of the legendary Manchester United Manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013, even before the Premier League was launched. Manchester United have fallen off their peak, since his retirement. Their average points a season were 79.4 from 1993 to 2003, then increased to 84.4 from 2003 to 2014, but fell down quite signifigantly to 68.1 from 2014 to 2024. This can be traced to areas such as poor recruitment, high manager turnover (10 managers since Sir Alex's retirement) and as fans and media would say, treating the club more like a business than a football club. Even with this drop off in average points a season, United are still the team with the highest win percentage at 59.69 % and the lowest loss percentage of 18.54 % in Premier League history. This is a testament to Sir Alex's vision, impact and methods (look up his famous hairdryer treatemnt), transforming Manchester United into a true powerhouse.

Liverpool - One of the most historical English clubs, Liverpool have finally overcame their Premier league drought in the 2019-20 season (And as of writing this have secured another premier league title in 2024-25). Liverpool in the years before 2016-17, were a very inconsistent team. One example, of this was them finishing 2nd in 2008-09 and then with their highest finish being 6th for the next 4 years. Their fortunes started to Change following the appointment of Legendary Liverpool Manager Jurgen Klopp in 2015. Now, In the 2015-16 season Liverpool did finish 8th, which was expected due to Jurgen Klopp joining mid season, with a poor Liverpool side. Post 2015-16 Liverpool's fortunes changed finishing outside the top 4 only once in 2022-23, due to an ageing squad that wasn't dealt with properly in the previous summer. They also won A Premier League title in 2019-20, with a historic 99 point triumph. They have also won a title recently, but that was after Jurgen Klopp's departure, but regardless he built the foundations for this year's title win as well. Liverpool's average points skyrocketed from an average of 65.6 from 1993-2014 and then a staggering rise to 78.5 from 2014 onwards. This is simply due to the incredible recruitment and Jurgen Klopps goal of building a long lasting foundation. A foundation that again had to be rebuilt in 2022-23, but was dealth with properly and helped continue Liverpool's might.
