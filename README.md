# DataAnalyticsProject1 - The Premier League's Big 6








## Overall Analysis
Before diving into a deeper analysis I wanted to look at some what I would say is more summarized data of the big 6. In particular, I want to look at points accumulated and data around their wins, draws and losses.

### Points Summary

Looking at the Barchart above, Manchester United were the Big 6 team with the most accumulated points at 2426, while Manchester City were the Big 6 team with the least accumulated points at 1796. Someone that started watching the premier league perhaps in the last decade might not believe that because of Manchester City's dominance in recent years, which is seen in the plot above. They have been so dominant in fact, that they have won the premier league 6 out of the last 8 years, with some notable seasons such as their centurion season back
