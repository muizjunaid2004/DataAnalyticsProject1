# DataAnalyticsProject1 - The Premier League's Big 6








## Overall Analysis
Before diving into a deeper analysis I wanted to look at some what I would say is more summarized data of the big 6. In particular, I want to look at points accumulated and data around their wins, draws and losses.

Looking at Figure1, Manchester United were the Big 6 team with the most accumulated points at 2426, while Manchester City were the Big 6 team with the least accumulated points at 1796. Someone who started watching the premier league perhaps in the last decade might not believe that because of Manchester City's dominance in recent years, [insert image]. They have been so dominant in fact, that they have won the premier league 6 out of the last 8 years, with some notable seasons such as their centurion season back in the 2017-18. From figure 2 we can also tell about overall dominance, lets go through all the teans.
