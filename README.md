# DataAnalyticsProject1 - The Premier League's Big 6

The goal of this project was to use data in storytelling of the Top 6 for my first data analysis project, through the data analysis tools of Python and Power BI. I found a premier league data set on kaggle and combined with the python library pandas was able to gain meangful insights from the data set. Have a look at the code if interested there are comments explaining it. Also I used Power BI through tp create a dashboard of data findings related to Manchester United.

Tools used: Python (Pandas), Power BI
Kaggle DataSet: 







## Overall Analysis
Before diving into a deeper analysis I wanted to look at some what I would say is more summarized data of the big 6. In particular, I want to look at points accumulated and data around their wins, draws and losses.

### Points Summary

Lets look at all the teams individually and see if we can make some sense from the data!

Manchester United - The most decorated club in Premier league history with 13 league titles [Insert Figure], but hve experienced a dramatic decline since their last title in the 2012-13 season.
p. Regardless, they do have the highest win percentage in Premier League History at 59.7 % [Insert Fgure] - a number has been negatively impacted due to their recent points average per season in the last decade. Their average points a season were 79.4 from 1993 to 2003, then increased to 84.4 from 2003 to 2014, but fell down quite signifigantly to 68.9 % from 2014 to 2024. All of this data presented shows the club have been struggling and the root cause is quite simple to pinpoint here. Its the fact that the club culture as a whole has gone down the drain since Legendary Manager Sir Alex Ferguson. He was the one steering the ship very successfully.
