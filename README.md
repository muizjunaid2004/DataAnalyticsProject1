# DataAnalyticsProject1 - The Premier League's Big 6

### Disclaimer: All data sets used were publicly available on Kaggle, a trusted source, but regardless the data may not be 100 % perfect. There was missing data, which had to be filled in during my analysis.

The goal of this project was to use data in storytelling of the Big 6 Premier League Clubs of (Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur) for my first data analysis project, through the data analysis tools of Python and Power BI. I found a premier league data set on kaggle and combined with the python library pandas was able to gain meangful insights from the data set. Have a look at the code if interested there are comments explaining it. Also I used Power BI through tp create a dashboard of data findings related to Manchester United.

Tools used: Python (Pandas), Power BI

## A Look at the Big 6's Premier League Journeys


Manchester United - A team that has gone from sheer dominance to a decline. They are the most decorated club in Premier League history, with 13 titles, a feat achieved thanks to the effort of the legendary Manchester United Manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013, even before the Premier League was launched. Manchester United have fallen off their peak, since his retirement. Their average points a season were 79.4 from 1993 to 2003, then increased to 84.4 from 2003 to 2014, but fell down quite signifigantly to 68.1 from 2014 to 2024. This can be traced to areas such as poor recruitment, high manager turnover (10 managers since Sir Alex's retirement) and as fans and media would say, treating the club more like a business than a football club. Even with this drop off in average points a season, United are still the team with the highest win percentage at 59.69 % and the lowest loss percentage of 18.54 % in Premier League history. This is a testament to Sir Alex's vision, impact and methods (look up his famous hairdryer treatemnt), transforming Manchester United into a true powerhouse.


Liverpool - One of the most historical English clubs, Liverpool have finally overcame their Premier league drought in the 2019-20 season (And as of writing this have secured another premier league title in 2024-25). Liverpool in the years before 2016-17, were a very inconsistent team. One example, of this was them finishing 2nd in 2008-09 and then with their highest finish being 6th for the next 4 years. Their fortunes started to Change following the appointment of Legendary Liverpool Manager Jurgen Klopp in 2015. Now, In the 2015-16 season Liverpool did finish 8th, which was expected due to Jurgen Klopp joining mid season, with a poor Liverpool side. Post 2015-16 Liverpool's fortunes changed finishing outside the top 4 only once in 2022-23, due to an ageing squad that wasn't dealt with properly in the previous summer. They also won A Premier League title in 2019-20, with a historic 99 point triumph. They have also won a title recently, but that was after Jurgen Klopp's departure, but regardless he built the foundations for this year's title win as well. Liverpool's average points skyrocketed from an average of 65.6 from 1993-2014 and then a staggering rise to 78.5 from 2014 onwards. This is simply due to the incredible recruitment and Jurgen Klopps goal of building a long lasting foundation. A foundation that again had to be rebuilt in 2022-23, but was dealth with properly and helped continue Liverpool's might.


Manchester City - A team that has gone from mid table mediocrity to the top of English football. City have only really come into the top 6 category in the last decade or so, with them winning all 8 of their Premier Leagues within the last 15 years. Before their takeover by Sheikh Mansour in 2008, Man City were always seen as an incosistent and mostly mid table club. They are the only big 6 club to be relegated, with 2 relegatons and a total of 4 seasons spent outside the Prmeier League. Post 2008 though is a completely different story, their rise has been impressive to say the least. They have won 6 out of the last Premier Leagues and have broken numerous records. Notable examples include being the only Premier League side to hit 100 points in their 2017-18 triumph and being being the only side to also win 4 titles in a row from 2020-24. This absolute rise has been due to not only incredible investment and long term recruitment by the owners, similar to Liverpool, but also their appointment of legendary manager Pep Guardiola, who is the manager credited with all of City's record breaking and dominance over the last decade.  City really went on quite the run with him, with an average points a season of 86.1 from 2014-2024, up from thier average points of 58.8 from the previous season

Arsenal - A great team, who these days are known as Second Place FC. Their most successful stint came in the early 2000's, in which they won 2 Premier Leagues in 2 years, in 2001-02 and 2003-04. Thee 2003-04 season was particularly special because they went invincible - winning 26 games and drawing 12. This dominance can be credited to their legendary manager Arsene Wenger. Arguably the most impactful manager in the history of the Premier League, bringing innovation in areas such as scouting, nutrition and player development. Wenger retired in 2018, but it hasnt been a trophy laden period for Arsenal. They actually broke a record no team would want. They are the team with the most 2nd place finishes in Premier League history, with 7 since 2000 and 3 over the last 3 seasons. Looking at their points average over the season it has remained within a close range. From 1993-2003 at 70.0, 2003-2013: 74.9 and 2013-2024: 72.0. In the 2013-2024 period it wouldve definetly dropped below 70, had it not been for the last 3 seasons, where they had an average points total of 82.3. 

Chelsea - 

Spurs - The least succesful team on the list and the one that holds the record for getting bantered the most. They have 0 premier league titles and have only finished second once in 2016-17. That season was particularly special because the current championship club (1 tier below PL) ended up triumphant. That was as close as Spurs got to tasting Silverware. Their points average per season have gone up over time, but with no trophies to show. Also, this season in particular they have finished at their lowest ever place of 17th. If youre still not convinced Spurs are the worst big 6 club, then maybe them having the lowest win percentage (44 %) and highest loss percentage (32 %), will be the final turning point.
